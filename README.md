# Maria Cunha Development Portfolio
## Description

My professional portfolio to showcase development work.

This is the beginning of my own developmental portfolio, which I plan to continue to expand upon as I practice and improve my coding skills.

At this time, the only project shared in this portfolio is a site refactor I completed for a marketing agency in order to make the site more accessible. The remaining links are placeholders (they currently go to my GitHub site) until I have real projects to replace them with.

When creating this page, I had the opportunity to practice my CSS skills. Specifically with creating flex boxes and adjusting positioning, padding, and margin so that the site was responsive.
